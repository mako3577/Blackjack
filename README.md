# Blackjack
This project doesn't represent my current knowledge. It was made in 2021 Sep.

I wrote it to practice my coding skills, especially tkinter.
I started it during "Learn Python Programming Masterclass" Udemy course, but I have significantly improved it.

Features created only by me:
- all tkinter objects are now scalling properly
- improved interface, good looking background image
- i've changed card images to ones with better resolution to look better when resized
- buttons locking after cards draw to avoid changing bet_value during the game
- money_add button for testing purposes
